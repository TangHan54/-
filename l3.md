# L3. Digital Logic Structures

Microprocessors contain millions of transistors.

1. Inverter (Not Gate)
2. NOR Gate
3. OR Gate
4. NAND Gate(AND-NOT)
5. AND Gate

## Combinational Logic Circuit
- output depends only on the current inputs
- always gives the same output for a given set of inputs
- stateless

## Sequential Logic Circuit
- output depends on the sequence of inputs(past and present)
- stores information from past inputs
## Decoder
- n iputs, 2^n outputs(2-bit decoder)
## Multiplexer (MUX)
- n-bit selector and 2^n inputs, one output
    - output equals one of the inputs, depending on selector
## Full Adder
- Add two bits and carry-in
- produce one-bit sum and carry-out
## Incrementer
## R-S Latch: Simple Storage Element
- R is used to 'reset' or 'clear' the element - set it to 0.
- S is used to 'set' the element - set it to 1.
## Memory
- RAM: Random Access Memory
    - SRAM: Static RAM
        - Fast, but not vwey dense
    - DRAM: Dynamic RAM
        - slower but dense
## State Machine
- another type of sequential circuit
    - combines combinational logic with storage
    - remember states, and change output based on inputs and current state
## State 
The state of a system is a snapshot of all the relevant elements of the system at the moment the snapshot is taken.
