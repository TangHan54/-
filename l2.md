# L2.Bits, Data Types, and Operations
## Data Representation 
1. Computer is a binary digital system.
2. Basic unit of information is the binary digit, or **bit**.
3. Values with more than two states require multiple bits.
    - a collection of n bits has 2^n possible states.
4. MOS Transistor
    - Mos = Metal Oxide Semiconductor
    - N-type and P-type
5. Logic Gates
    - use switch behaviour of MOS transistors to implement logical functions: AND , OR , NOT
